# Learning Notes

Here you will find notes from the books I read, the videos I watch, the articles I study and the podcasts I listen to.

## Taking notes

Being more proactive in synthesising the content I read, watch or listen to. 
This helps me to : 
- make the content my own
- structure my thinking
- keep track of my learning
