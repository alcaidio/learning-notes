# Startup Contracts Explained: 5 Risks You Take

## What is the SHA?
- The **Shareholders Agreement (SHA)** is a legal document that defines how control of the company is shared among shareholders.
- It covers important areas, such as dilution, board seats, and investor rights.
- The SHA can be complex and subject to negotiation, so it's essential to consider several key clauses before signing.

## Key Clauses to Consider in the SHA

### 1. **Dilution**
- **Dilution** happens when new shares are issued to raise capital, reducing the ownership percentage of existing shareholders.
- **Anti-dilution** clauses can protect certain shareholders from dilution, but this increases dilution for others.
- Famous examples, like Facebook's early days, highlight how one shareholder may take the dilution hit while others remain unaffected.

### 2. **Board of Directors**
- The **Board of Directors** functions similarly to a Parliament in democracies, influencing key company decisions and electing the CEO.
- **Board seats** are determined by shareholders, but not all votes carry equal weight. Influence depends on negotiation and standing in the company.
- For example, a co-founder with only 20% ownership may hold two board seats, while another with the same ownership holds none.

### 3. **Tag-Along Rights**
- **Tag-Along rights** protect minority shareholders when a majority shareholder sells their stake.
- Minority shareholders have the right to sell their shares at the same price and terms as the majority holder, ensuring they are not left out of a profitable deal.

### 4. **Drag-Along Rights**
- **Drag-Along rights** allow a majority shareholder to force minority shareholders to sell their shares under the same terms if the company is being sold.
- This ensures a smooth exit for majority shareholders when selling the company.

### 5. **Employee Share Option Pool**
- Employees can be incentivized with shares through an **Employee Share Option Pool**.
- When new shares are created for the pool, **dilution** occurs for existing shareholders.
- Certain investors or founders may negotiate protection against dilution from the share option pool, leaving others to bear the dilution.

## Conclusion
- These five key clauses—dilution, board seats, tag-along rights, drag-along rights, and employee share options—are critical to understand before signing the SHA.
- Negotiation and awareness of these clauses can have long-term impacts on control and ownership in a startup.
