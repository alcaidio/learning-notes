# Managing Startup Finances by Kirsty Nathoo

# Pitfall

- Know your cash balance and runway at all times
- Understand how your expenses are going to increase over time
- Understand that a high ratio of revenue/employees is better than # of employees
- Assume you’ll never raise money again, so have a plan to reaching profitability
- Don’t hire too quickly, and make sure each hire is an investment. The best startup do more with less.
- Everyone is responsible for the numbers!
