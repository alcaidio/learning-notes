# Product market fit & retention

~~“If you build it, they will come”.~~ → “If you build it, they won’t come”

[Do things that dont scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html). Talk to your users and watch them use your product.

How to use **data** to understand if you’ve made something people want ?

1. Identify the **metric** that represent the value my users get from the product
2. Measure the **repeat usage** of that metric

> **Retention** is the best way to measure PMF

Other (worse way) to measure PMF :

- Net promoter score - not great
- Survey - often biased
- “How would u feel if u can no longer use the product?”

Bad metric for PMF :

- Registered users
- Visitors
- “Conversion rate”
- “Customers that aren’t paying”

# Growth channels & Tactics

Two ways to grow at scale :

1. Product Growth / Conversion rate optimization (inside the app)
2. Growth Channels (outside the app)

## Product Growth

Product is a funnel / growth loop - Every step in the funnel have drop-off

```
Exemple :

At airbnb P1 (home) P2 (search result) P3 (listing page) P4 (booking page).

%people P1 → P4
```

The job is to figure out :

- How many people make it that far?
- Why are they dropping off ?
- What can I do to increase that number?

Conversion rate optimization areas :

- Internationalization
- Authentification flow
- Onboarding
- Purchase conversion

## Paid growth

- Don’t do paid growth if u don’t have revenue
- CAC = Customer Acquisition Cost
- CAC / Payback time (Most important metric in online marketing)

## Search engine optimization

SEO - two main levers :

1. On page optimization
   1. Every optimization starts with keyword research
   2. Which page am i trying to rank ?
2. Off-page optimization
   1. Who is linking to you?
